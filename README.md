## Overview

Codegment provides a clean, responsive development environment designed for programmers who need a fast, extensible code editor with visual elegance. Leveraging the rendering performance of Kivy, Material Design components from KivyMD, and the tokenization capabilities of Pygments, Codegment delivers an agile editing workflow with cross-platform desktop support.

## Core Capabilities

- Syntax Highlighting: Comprehensive token highlighting powered by Pygments, supporting dozens of programming languages and color schemes, including built-in support for Kivy language (.kv) files.
- Code Completion: Contextual word suggestions and auto-completion dialogs for rapid coding.
- Search and Replace: In-editor search functionality with navigation across occurrences and direct replacement tools.
- Multi-Tab Editing: Open, edit, and switch between multiple documents simultaneously.
- Dynamic Typography: In-place font scaling to adjust editor text dimensions seamlessly.
- Configuration Persistence: User preferences and editor settings are stored in an INI configuration file.
- Real-Time Coordinates: Bottom status bar tracks cursor row and column positions alongside the active lexer.
